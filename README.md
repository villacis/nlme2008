Note:

Make sure to download the next files:
- Code.m - This file will run the estimations
- data.mat - This is the data file you need to replicate the example I discuss in my website (https://alexisvillacis.wordpress.com/2020/09/07/an-application-of-non-linear-mixed-effects-models-using-matlab/)

If you benefit from this code, make sure to cite this paper that motivated me to write and share this code:
